# When to Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs with Selective Disclosure

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) with Selective Disclosure are powerful privacy-preserving techniques. This guide helps you understand when and why you might want to implement them in your applications.

## Use Cases for ZKP Selective Disclosure

### 1. Age Verification Without Revealing Birth Date

**Scenario**: A website needs to verify a user is over 18 without storing their full birth date.

**Implementation**:
- The issuer (government) issues a verifiable credential with the user's birth date.
- The user (holder) creates a ZKP presentation that only proves they are over 18.
- The website (verifier) can confirm eligibility without knowing the exact birth date.

### 2. Healthcare Information Sharing

**Scenario**: A patient needs to prove their vaccination status to an employer without revealing other medical information.

**Implementation**:
- Healthcare provider issues a comprehensive health credential.
- Patient selectively discloses only vaccination status.
- Employer verifies vaccination without accessing allergies, medications, or other sensitive health data.

### 3. Financial Qualification Verification

**Scenario**: A mortgage application requires proof of financial stability without revealing exact account balances.

**Implementation**:
- Bank issues credential with detailed financial information.
- Applicant creates ZKP proving they meet minimum requirements.
- Mortgage provider verifies qualification without seeing exact income or account balances.

### 4. Academic Credentials

**Scenario**: A job applicant needs to prove they graduated from a specific university without revealing grades or other academic details.

**Implementation**:
- University issues a complete academic credential.
- Graduate selectively discloses only degree achievement.
- Employer verifies graduation status without seeing GPA or course details.

### 5. Identity Verification with Minimal Disclosure

**Scenario**: A service needs to verify a user's identity without collecting unnecessary personal data.

**Implementation**:
- Government issues a verifiable ID credential.
- User selectively discloses only name and photo.
- Service verifies identity without accessing address, ID number, or other sensitive information.

## Benefits of ZKP Selective Disclosure

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: Reveals only what's necessary, nothing more.
2. **Data Minimization**: Aligns with regulatory requirements like GDPR.
3. **Reduced Data Liability**: Verifiers don't store sensitive information they don't need.
4. **User Control**: Individuals decide what information to share and when.
5. **Trust Preservation**: Maintains the integrity and authenticity of credentials while protecting privacy.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Cryptographic Overhead**: ZKP operations can be computationally intensive.
2. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure compatibility with W3C Verifiable Credentials and DID standards.
3. **Key Management**: Secure management of cryptographic keys is essential.
4. **Revocation**: Consider how credentials can be revoked when implementing a system.
5. **User Experience**: Balance security requirements with usability.

## When Not to Use ZKP

1. When all credential data needs to be disclosed anyway.
2. In extremely performance-sensitive applications where the cryptographic overhead isn't justified.
3. When simpler cryptographic solutions would suffice.

## IOTA Identity Implementation

IOTA Identity provides a robust framework for implementing ZKP Selective Disclosure through:

- **JSON Proof Tokens (JPT)**: An extension of the JWT format supporting selective disclosure.
- **BBS+ Signatures**: Advanced cryptographic signatures allowing for selective disclosure proofs.
- **DID Integration**: Seamless integration with the Decentralized Identifier ecosystem.

For implementation details, refer to the examples in this repository demonstrating both basic and advanced ZKP techniques.
